it might not make sense for an artist to sell cheap open editions that allow permanent streaming rights.

so maybe there's a way to time box use while maintaining a permanent record of ownership (for social purposes).

i know very little about the music industry, so this could be completely off base, but i wonder how realistic it is for an artist to rent their songs for non-commercial use using subscription nfts (""non-commercial"" is the key word here).

that could ensure the artist gets paid directly while giving you the ability to play their song on any app and across any website.

240,146,146 fan reward,"this is why i love crypto so much.

fred again is playing his first stadium show, the biggest of his career after his meteoric rise. 

before the show, he personally tracked down the 150 people that attended in 2021 before he blew up and invited them to a secret listening party.

if ticketing was onchain, fred would always know who his early fans were and which shows they attended without needing to rely on ticketmaster, dice, etc.

at its core, onchain ticketing is basically a public database of attendance that no single company can own or gate keep.

it’s not always about coins and their prices.

sure, if you had a ticket to one of fred’s early shows you could probably sell it for a lot of money.

but…

not only would fred be able to immediately identify you as an early fan, but he’d also be able to automatically send an invitation to one of these secret shows.

he could program conditions around the invitation too. for example, he could say every person that attended my first LA show will receive a NON-TRANSFERABLE ticket to my secret listening party (as a way to combat toxic resellers). 

he could perform in any city and program merch sales so that anyone that attended a previous show gets free merch.

you can probably imagine an infinite number of scenarios. there are so many creative possibilities for artists to express their gratitude for early fans.

and on the flip side, it gives fans the opportunity to express their gratitude too. 

i personally traveled to multiple cities just to see fred perform on his 2022 tour. 

i wish i had a way to prove that and signal my fandom, even if it had no financial upside.

i haven’t thought too deeply about why exactly but it feels good to make my enthusiasm for his music known.

his music has powered a lot of memories that mean a lot to me.

we’re a ways away from this happening, but i hope someday he’ll continue creatively rewarding his early fans. and i hope im one of them.

247,139,139 vinyl records,"collecting vinyl records have become a deliberate act of preserving music culture.

it's hard to imagine a future where record collecting doesn't evolve into music nfts.

some thoughts 🧵

record collecting revolves as much around displaying as it does creating.

the thrill of the hunt and the art of crate digging (searching for obscure artifacts, often by thrifting) is a core part of the experience.

crate digging is about discovering rare and obscure records that few others have.

It's about uncovering hidden gems through hours of searching.

and everyone loves a good hidden gem. why?

first, it's way to demonstrate superior knowledge, taste, and status through the rarity and eclecticism of their finds.

collecting can often be a status game.

but hidden gems also have financial value.

if you're reading this, you've likely collected an nft, so i don't need to explain the social and financial upside of owning  rare/coveted artifacts.

*especially* if you collect something from an artist before they become more popular.

music nfts not only add new possibilities to the form factor of collecting, but they also add new possibilities to the way they can be collected.

it might not be the dominant way we discover and consume music, but there will inevitably be   limited releases of music at some point in the future via music nfts.

imagine exclusive tracks:

+ airdropped to top streamers
+ claimed at a live show
+ sold as a limited-edition release

and the only way to hear the track/album is by owning it.

the entire meatspace becomes a giant crate to dig, not just secondhand record stores.

learning musical history and connecting to a genre's culture becomes more fun and spontaneous.

and if that ever happens, there's bound to be  an ecosystem of products that form around these new music collectibles: both hardware and software.

things we display in our homes and personal spaces, where we most express our taste and identity.

the interfaces will focus more on displaying the historical provenance of a collectible than on the playback experience.

the core part of the ux is the story behind the track, and the ease of displaying and sharing with others.",art|identity|rewards,3,art

""i wish i could mint this""

at some point in the future, it becomes a cultural artifact. proving you were there when kitty resurfaced will have social value and surely some financial upside.

the ability to mint anything (read: capturing some material from a moment in time) adds a new dimension to collecting—what is considered a basic human instinct.

instead of vinyl records, stamps, sneakers or baseball cards, imagine you can tell a richer story about yourself with moments.

because that's why we collect anything at all, isn't it? 

we want to evoke memories and tell a story, and ultimately use that to connect with others who share our interests and values.

maybe someday we'll get to a point where peeling off a small piece of a moment on the internet can become completely ubiquitous.",art,1,art

252,134,134 psychographics,"psychographic personas are a massive and underrated design unlock.

i'll demonstrate why, using michael saylor and ansem as examples for a trading product:

users should be at the core of every design decision.

but how do you do that, exactly?

by creating fictional characters based on real data to tell compelling stories about user needs.

psychographics are a necessary ingredient for rich and actionable storytelling.

unlike demographics (like age, gender, and location), psychographics (personality, values, and interests) dive deeper into motivations and tendencies.

let’s use a really simple framework to create our personas—the Big Five personality traits:

1. openness: curiosity, imagination, and willingness to try new things.

2. conscientiousness: being organized, dependable, and self-disciplined.
3. extraversion: sociability, assertiveness, and tendency to seek stimulation.

4. agreeableness: being cooperative, compassionate, and trusting.

5. neuroticism: tendency to experience negative emotions like anxiety, depression, and mood swings.

now let's plot ansem and saylor along this framework.

(idk much about their personalities, so i'll make a guess)

for the sake of argument let's just say saylor is more conscientious and ansem is more open and extraverted.
because saylor is less open, we can assume he likes things that are familiar and straightforward.

the ui should look and feel like other financial tools he's used to, avoiding any experimental interface designs.
ansem would hate that.

being very open and extraverted, he loves new experiences and actively seeks out stimulation.

it would be worth investing in dynamic visuals, animations, and interactive elements to keep him engaged.

with low conscientiousness and moderate neuroticism, ansem tends to be impulsive and seeks instant gratification—so it's worth making real-time price action the focal point.

he'll also respond well to gamified features, so there's reason to prioritize ideating ways to gamify P/L.

impulsive tendencies can also often translate to a willingness to move fast and emotionally, which means we can assume any over the top security features will become a frustrating burden for him.

i'd probably prioritize mobile since he's most likely not using a hardware wallet.

whereas saylor's personality is more conservative, he'll go out of his way to use a hardware wallet.

he also requires more detailed and structured data because of his high conscientiousness.

he'll prefer high info density with sections and tabs to stay organized.

give him a web ui. he'll never use mobile for important actions.

he moves deliberately, reads whitepapers, and researches thoroughly so he'll appreciate an easy way to navigate technical data.

because he's not neurotic or agreeable, you can expect him to be skeptical and prefer clear, unemotional messaging in the ui.

saylor's low extraversion means he might have a hard time taking social features seriously.

but a product with forums, chat, and social proof will be much more sticky for someone with ansem's extraversion.

this exercise hopefully shows how vastly different a product might be when you prioritize one over the other.

there is certainly no way to appeal to both, and that's an incredible design constraint.

granted, this is an oversimplified example. but it hopefully demonstrates how a small amount of personality context can go a very long way in the design process.

these insights can be applied to the design strategy (how it should work) and also have tangible implications on the ui (how it should look).

there is no one way to present a persona. as long as it's based on real observations and, most importantly, prioritized, it will help you tell a story.

in the early stages of the design process (before testing and prototyping), stories are the ultimate measure of success for a design.

it's a shared reference across everyone working on a product, a guiding force and lens to evaluate a design.

it's the basis for decision-making.
while psychographics remain a debated tool (they can create unnecessary bias, be too ambiguous compared to other user-centered methods) they're my secret weapon for early stage ideation.

313,74,074 high-effort replies (proposal),"using social proof and visual cues to increase high-effort replies:

research has found that simply seeing faces, even briefly, activates the part of our brain that recognizes friends, priming us to be more social and engaged.

seeing familiar faces within proximity of content in the feed of friends provides a powerful social motivation, incentivizing people to interact.

when users see their friends have interacted with a post, they perceive the content as more valuable and are more motivated to engage with intent.

once users are primed and motivated to engage, the interface should adapt and nudge the action. in this case, it could be as simple as presenting the input directly within the content (eliminating the extra click).

a study from NIH found that users were significantly more likely to provide a well-formed, substantive response to an open-ended question when presented with a prominent text input.

in short, pairing familiar faces (social proof) and prominent inputs can potentially improve users' motivation to engage with high-effort replies.",messaging|social,2,social

345,58,057 proof of focus,"Internet addiction is an equally beautiful and terrifying thing. 

On the one hand it’s a trait a lot of people in the crypto universe share and that common way of being in the world brings folks together across different backgrounds. On the other hand, being so hyperconnected can wreck your mental health and attention span so much that you can’t focus on anything other than doomscrolling.

So, what is the solution here? How do we stay online but reclaim some ability to concentrate on meaningful activities, whether that is work or play? I think the answer has more to do with sticks than carrots and that is what we’re trying to explore with Proof of Focus.

This concept works in several steps. 

First, select behaviors you want to avoid (and for a specific window of time). For example, checking TikTok on your phone over the next 3 hours. Second, stake ETH as collateral for the purity of your attention. Let’s say 0.1 ETH here because you have an important memo you need to write for work. Third, if you participate in any of the behaviors on your blacklist during the specified window, that staked ETH is slashed. Check TikTok? Say goodbye to the ETH.

What this offers people is a mechanism for putting digital skin in the game. Do you really want to concentrate? Then bet on yourself. When you’re tempted to break your workflow and go check social media a ‘Proof of Focus’ stake would create an actual cost to that interruption, and the hope is that would be enough to keep you (more) on task.",invest|social|trading,3,invest

347,56,055 meme editions,"updated 6/19/24:

life after memecoins. i have an idea, hear me out:

i think we can build an attention economy on top of open editions.

let me explain.

we formed markets around the variations of erc-721s, some metadata was valued more than others (i.e. hoodie punk is better than mohawk punk).

they were more expressive and created new status games on the internet, which made crypto fun because it pushed it into mainstream culture.

but the problem is the jpegs are far less liquid.

so we went back to trading attention around erc-20 tokens (aka coins). the coins could be bought and sold a lot faster and with less effort.

but what we gained in velocity and liquidity, we lost in social expression (the thing that arguably made nfts so fun).

so here we are on two extreme ends of the degen spectrum.

but what if there was something in the middle? pictures with high fungibility that can be traded like shitcoins but  also let you visually express your taste.

what’s the difference between trading $wif and trading a million erc-1155 pictures of dog wearing the hat?

i’ll tell you what the difference is. with 1155’s we can trade actual media like shitcoins.
 
boom. that’s it.
 
now instead of trading tickers, we can not only trade memes but we can trade ART, MUSIC, WRITTEN ESSAYS, PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS or whatever the fuck else we’ve been minting as worthless open editions the last few years.
 
and we can trade them at the same velocity as highly fractionalized tokens that alsooooo have the visceral material that we can connect to emotionally (a fancy way of saying “jpegs” basically).

how fucking cool would that be?
 
why can’t we create market makers for a @jshorne essay, a @jackbutcher or @0xlght  art piece, an @rac or @imdanielallan track, a @ufo__club or @chaserchapman podcast episode, those creepy looking @farcaster_xyz protocol upgrades?
 
we should normalize minting onchain media with a supply in the bajillions so they have the liquidity of these lame coins we’re sloshing money around in.

the thing that’s missing is a user-friendly marketplace or AMM protocol, an idea i’ve explored before and honestly thought was really stupid until now… 🤔

it adds another substantial dimension to this attention economy that we're all trying to create generational wealth in.

that added dimension creates space for culture, all kinds of culture, especially the ones that transcend crypto twitter.

it opens up the market for all kinds of creative output.

and gives power to tastemakers, curators, and tribes and gives us the chance to relate to one another via ownership again.",art|identity|trading,3,art

516,245,Private Transactions,"This concept, co-created with @AleoHQ, explores the future of everyday crypto with public ledgers.

What does the future look like when everything is onchain? The North Star use case for crypto is buying a cup of coffee. It's always been the ultimate measure of adoption. If we (anyone, everyone) can buy a coffee with crypto, we can buy anything with crypto. I don't know if it's inevitable, but on a long enough time horizon, it's very likely we'll get there.

But there's one problem... Even if the moment of purchase is simple, intuitive, and frictionless—a design utopia— I would still think twice. I don't want to buy a coffee if everyone online and in proximity (the barista, other customers) can see my balance and transaction history.

In its current state, everyday purchases with crypto means retailers basically have their own public ledgers. It's not that farfetched. And it's weird. If the future of crypto is multi-chain, at least some of those chains will need to be private and secured with zk.

Making web3 easier to use is key, but not at the cost of personal privacy. After all, some transactions are better kept private, and ensuring privacy might just be the catalyst for adoption.",payments|privacy,2,payments

You can't send crypto to anyone in any country. You can only send crypto to crypto users in any country.

Going from receiving crypto to spending it on everyday things sometimes feels impossible.
