# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create Stress Test Scenarios
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop stress test scenarios to verify performance with large item collections.
# Details:
Implement the 30 fps stress test with 1,550 items on M2 MacBook as specified in the QA matrix. Create additional stress tests for mobile devices. Measure and optimize performance under heavy load. Identify and fix any memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.

# Test Strategy:
Run stress tests on target devices. Measure FPS, memory usage, and texture loading times under load. Compare results against performance targets. Document any performance degradation patterns.
