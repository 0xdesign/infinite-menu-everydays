# Title: Create Jump Controls Visibility Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement logic to control when jump controls are visible based on device and user interaction.
# Details:
Address open question #2 about jump controls visibility. Implement configurable visibility logic that can be set to 'always visible' or 'visible on hover' for desktop. For mobile, show on first tap and hide after a timeout. Make this configurable via a simple settings option.

# Test Strategy:
Test visibility behavior on desktop and mobile. Verify that controls appear and disappear as expected based on user interaction. Test with different configuration options.
