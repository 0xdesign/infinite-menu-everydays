# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Feature Flag System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a feature flag system to gradually roll out new functionality.
# Details:
Implement a simple feature flag system that allows the recycling engine and other features to be enabled/disabled via configuration. This supports the milestone plan of having the recycling engine behind a flag in week 1. Ensure the system doesn't add new peer dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Test that features can be enabled/disabled via flags. Verify that the application works correctly in all flag combinations. Ensure the flag system doesn't impact performance.
