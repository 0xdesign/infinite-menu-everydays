# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Responsive Layout Adaptations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the application is responsive across all device sizes from 320px to 4K.
# Details:
Implement a fluid layout that works from 320px to 4K displays. Add support for pinch-to-zoom to show extra concentric shells on mobile devices. Ensure all UI elements (jump controls, search drawer, progress ring, filter chips) adapt appropriately to different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test on various screen sizes and devices. Verify that pinch-to-zoom works correctly on mobile. Ensure all UI elements are usable and properly positioned across the full range of supported screen sizes.
