# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize Performance for Mobile Devices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the application maintains 60 FPS on mid-tier mobile devices with efficient resource usage.
# Details:
Profile and optimize the rendering pipeline to maintain 60 FPS on mid-tier mobile devices. Keep disc instance count ≤ 100 as specified. Implement texture loading optimizations to stay within the 30 MB GPU RAM budget. Use requestAnimationFrame efficiently and minimize garbage collection during animation.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing on target devices (including iPhone 12). Measure frame rate, memory usage, and texture loading times. Verify that frame drops are ≤ 5% on iPhone 12.
