# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Type-ahead Search Drawer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a command palette style search drawer (⌘K) that allows users to quickly find and navigate to specific items.
# Details:
Implement a type-ahead search drawer that can be activated with ⌘K. The drawer should filter the logical data array based on user input and show matching items. When an item is selected, animate the wheel until the chosen item is front-facing. Include keyboard navigation within search results.

# Test Strategy:
Test search functionality with various query patterns. Verify that selecting an item correctly positions it front-facing. Test keyboard accessibility and ensure the drawer works on all target devices.
