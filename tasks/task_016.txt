# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Session Storage Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a strategy for persisting user state across sessions.
# Details:
Address open question #3 about caching START_OFFSET. Implement both per-session and 24h visitor caching options for START_OFFSET. Also store viewed items progress to maintain the progress ring accuracy. Use localStorage for 24h persistence and sessionStorage for session-only persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test that state is correctly persisted and retrieved. Verify that the 24h expiration works correctly. Test behavior when storage is full or disabled.
