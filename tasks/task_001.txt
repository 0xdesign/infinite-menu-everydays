# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Virtual Window Recycling Architecture
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core architecture for virtual window recycling that maintains 42 GPU instances and recycles them as they pass behind the sphere.
# Details:
Implement the data cursor logic as outlined in the technical approach. Create a `useInfiniteWindow` hook that manages the logical IDs array and the recycling mechanism. Implement the `reuseSlot` function that updates the logical ID when an instance passes behind the sphere. Ensure the WebGL instances are properly updated with new texture coordinates.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the recycling logic. Verify that instances are correctly recycled and bound to new items. Test with a mock dataset of 750+ items to ensure all items can be reached.
