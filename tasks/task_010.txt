# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Texture Atlas Loading Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a strategy for loading texture atlases efficiently to balance performance and memory usage.
# Details:
Implement a strategy for loading texture atlases. Consider both preloading all atlases and streaming after N spins (addressing open question #1). Implement texture atlases pre-baked at 4096Â² as specified, with fallback to dynamic atlas if GPU MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE < 4096. Optimize texture memory usage to stay within the 30 MB GPU RAM budget.

# Test Strategy:
Test atlas loading performance on various devices. Measure memory usage and loading times. Test the fallback mechanism on devices with limited texture size support.
