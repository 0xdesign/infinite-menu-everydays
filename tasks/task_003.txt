# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Randomized Start Offset
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add functionality to randomize the starting position of the wheel on each visit to ensure users see different items.
# Details:
Implement the START_OFFSET logic that randomly selects a starting point in the items array (rand(0...items.length-1)). Store this offset in session storage to maintain consistency during a session. Initialize the wheel with this offset on component mount.

# Test Strategy:
Test that different sessions generate different start offsets. Verify that refreshing the page within the same session maintains the same offset.
