# Task ID: 13
# Title: Add Analytics Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement analytics events to track user interactions with the infinite menu.
# Details:
Implement analytics events as specified: item_viewed, batch_jump, search_used. Include relevant metadata such as item IDs with each event. Ensure analytics are non-blocking and don't impact performance. Use the existing analytics infrastructure without adding new dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that events are correctly emitted with the right payload. Test that analytics don't impact performance. Use a mock analytics service for testing.
