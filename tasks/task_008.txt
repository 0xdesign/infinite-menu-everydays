# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Category Filter Chips
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the existing category filter design with the new recycling logic.
# Details:
Adapt the existing category filter chips to work with the new recycling logic. Implement a horizontally scrollable bar for mobile. When a category is selected, filter the logical data array and update the wheel to show only items from that category while maintaining the recycling behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test that category filtering works correctly with the recycling logic. Verify that horizontal scrolling works on mobile. Test edge cases like selecting a category with few items.
