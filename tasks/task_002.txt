# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Behind-the-Sphere Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a detection mechanism that identifies when a disc passes behind the sphere to trigger the recycling logic.
# Details:
Implement the detector that compares instance world z < -radius Ã— 0.2 to determine when a disc is behind the sphere. When detected, call the `reuseSlot` function to update the instance with the next unseen item. This should be integrated into the render loop to continuously check positions.

# Test Strategy:
Create visual tests that highlight when discs are detected as 'behind'. Verify the detection threshold works correctly at different camera angles and zoom levels.
